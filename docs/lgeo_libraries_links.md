# NOTES
* Order of installation: lutz < owenfix < darats < mjh
* All part names beginning with between one and three number characters should be padded with zeroes until there are four numbers total. Some of Owen's parts seem to not do this for whatever reason.
* Some parts have numbers and letters toward the end of their names. These letters and numbers don't count toward the four number character limit.
* Some parts names begin with letters instead of numbers. These do not need to be padded either.
* Lars' parts appear to be older than Lutz's most recent update. Therefore I have ignored it in all of my tools.

# OTHER LIBRARIES
* lp_orion - Orion Pobursky, non-LGEO format but is supported by LDView, https://github.com/billthefish/LDrawPOV, https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldrawpov/
* ar_old - Anton Raves, old library, non-LGEO format but is supported by L3P and included with AIOI, is there a download link to obtain the old library just by itself?
