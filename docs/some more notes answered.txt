* As of 2019/07/01, the official AIOI seems to include Owen's parts but not Damien's parts.
  : True!
* As of 2019/07/01, the latest LGEO parts by Damien are missing "lg_2345p44.inc" and "lg_3794a.inc", even though they are listed in his "LGEO.xml".
  : Parts have been created and are ready for my next release.
* The LGEO files "lg_10197.inc", "lg_10288.inc" and "lg_85940.inc" reference an object named "lg_tech_tube", but this object is not missing from Damien's "lg_defs.inc".
  : Parts have been created and are ready for my next release. So no more need of "lg_tech_tube".
* As of 2019/07/01, in Damien's version of "LGEO.xml" color 406 "lg_rubber_dark_purple" should be renamed to "lg_rubber_dark_blue" (or vice versa, I'm not entirely sure).
  : I don't know either.
  : Renamed to "lg_rubber_dark_blue"
* In the LGEO library, ABS and PC plastic parts do not have any normals. Parts made of other materials (e.g. rubber, pearl, chrome, transparent) do have normals, however.
  : I have attached my personnal "lg_color.inc" file which should correct that. Please be careful because I have tweaked the colors to suit my personnal taste, they are not defined based on whatever color chart. Be aware of that.
* By default, sloped parts don't have alternative normals, despite that the sloped parts themselves have always supported this feature. Some programs add normals to these parts, however.\
  : I have attached my personnal "lg_color.inc" file which should correct that. Please be careful because I have tweaked the colors to suit my personnal taste, they are not defined based on whatever color chart. Be aware of that.
* As of 2019/07/01, the latest version of LGEO's "lg_color.inc" file is missing many colors, such as "color 495 - Electric_Contact_Copper" and "color 339 - Glitter_Trans_Neon_Green". This file needs to be updated to reflect the most current "LDConfig.ldr" file.\
  : My lg_color.inc" file should have a bit more of them.
* LGEO materials do not support SSLT or blurred reflections.
  : Be careful with that as it will signifiquently increase the rendering time with PovRay, which already not really fast. But it needs to be studied.
* In Owen's LGEO library the part "lg_756" is listed twice in "LGEO.xml".
  : I have it on my library as "lg_0756", so it might not be needed anymore.
* "LDConfig.ldr" treats Glow_In_Dark_Opaque, Milky_White, Glow_In_Dark_Trans and Glow_In_Dark_White as partially transparent. LGEO treats some of these as fully solid.
  : It might be a bit different in my "lg_color" definition
* It might be better to remove the zero padding from all LGEO part names so that they match the original LDraw part names. The padding serves no real purpose as far as I can tell, and just makes things a little bit more confusing for everyone.
  : Even if I've used zeros for less than 4 digit part numbers, I would 100% agree to remove them.
* Should LGEO part names all be lower case? Should LGEO part names match the case of the original LDraw part names? Does it matter?
  : Yes, I would put lower cases everywhere even if PovRay is not case-sensitve with ".inc" files
