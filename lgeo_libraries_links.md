#OWEN
* All part names beginning with between one and three number characters should be padded with zeroes until there are four numbers total. Some of Owen's parts seem to not do this for whatever reason.
* Some parts have numbers and letters toward the end of their names. These letters and numbers don't count toward the four number character limit.
* Some parts names begin with letters instead of numbers. These do not need to be padded either.
